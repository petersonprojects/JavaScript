There’s a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities
 of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,
 shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is 
 truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children and I will 
 strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who 
 attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know I am the Lord 
 when I lay my vengeance upon you!

Now... I been sayin’ that shit for years and if you ever heard it, 
that meant your ass. You’d be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant,
 I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I 
 popped a cap in his ass, but I saw some shit this mornin’ made me think twice.

See, now I’m thinking: maybe it means you’re the evil man 
and I’m the righteous man and Mr. 9 mm here, he’s the shepherd protecting 
my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.

Or it could mean you’re the righteous man and I’m the shepherd and 
it’s the world that’s evil and selfish and I’d like that, 
but that shit ain’t the truth. The truth is you’re the weak and I’m the 
tyranny of evil men. But I’m tryin’, Ringo. I’m tryin’ real hard to be 
the shepherd.
